## Updating Dictionaries

All dictionaries are automatically re-generated **every day** at midnight. The proccess is using the latest Wiktionary dump available at that time.
The `dicthml-LOCALE.zip` file is updated inplace so that the download link never changes.

- You should open an [issue](https://github.com/BoboTiG/ebook-reader-dict/issues) if:
   - you do not find a word;
   - a definition is not similar to the one on Wiktionary;
   - a definition is missing.
- If a definition is not good for you, changes are to be done on [Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/) directly.
  Your changes will likely be included in the next Wiktionary dump, so when it will come, at most 24h later the new dictionary will contain your stuff :)
